  description: The Tanuki is a rugged, Militarised cargo shuttle from Militia Ironworks. Featuring an easily modifiable cargo bay and heavy-duty armor, it is designed to be the ultimate framework (and drone hunter) for Militia and Independent operators. It carries a healthy amount of laser firepower for its size, sporting 2 Prometheus Laser Cannons for long-range effective fire and 3 Cerberus Plasma Scattercannons for melting hostiles in close range. Houses a small galley and medbay, standard for militia ships, and is FTL capable.
  price: 115000 # 95K base + 20K for medical/galley.
